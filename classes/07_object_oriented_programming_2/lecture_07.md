## Inheritance

Inheritance is taking the abstractions we create with Objects one step further

Imagine we have a class for various kinds of shapes: `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, `Octohedron`, and so on. Instead of just creating a class for `Rectangle` and a class for `Triangle`, we make the logical leap that both of these are polygons and thus have some things in common. So we create a `Polygon` class for our other shapes to inherit from.

Let's see some concrete examples:

```python
class Polygon:

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.number_of_sides = n

    def print_num_sides(self):
        '''a quick, informational print statement'''
        print('There are ' + str(self.number_of_sides) + ' sides.')

class Rectangle(Polygon):

    def __init__(self, lengths_of_sides):
        Polygon.__init__(self, 4)
        self.lengths_of_sides = lengths_of_sides  # list of two numbers

    def get_area(self):
        '''return the area of the rectangle: length x width'''
        x, y = self.lengths_of_sides
        return x * y

class Triangle(Polygon):

    def __init__(self, lengths_of_sides):
        Polygon.__init__(self, 3)
        self.lengths_of_sides = lengths_of_sides  # list of three numbers

    def get_area(self):
        '''return the area of the triangle using the semi-perimeter method'''
        a, b, c = self.lengths_of_sides

        # calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        return (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5
```

There are a few things to notice here. First of all, the `Polygon` class is very simple. In the class signatures for `Triangle` and `Rectangle` we actually reference the `Polygon` class. Then in the `__init__` methods for each `Triangle` and `Rectangle` class we reference the `Polygon` `__init__` method, so that when we create a `Triangle` class, we are also initializing the attributes of a `Polygon` class, and including it's methods.

We can create an instance of `Polygon` by doing:

```python
>>> p = Polygon(9)
>>> p.print_num_sides()
There are 9 sides.
```

And if we create a `Triangle`, we can call both the methods in `Triangle` and those in `Polygon`:

```python
>>> tri = Triangle([3, 4, 5])
>>> print(tri.get_area())
6.0
>>> tri.print_num_sides()
3
```

We have created a connection between the idea of a triangle and the idea of a polygon. We say that "Triangle inherits from Polygon". We have set up a conceptual connection such that everything in `Polygon` should appear in `Triangle`. We use this connection in code to help us think about the logic of our situation. The goal is to create relationships among the ideas that we can represent in the code.

<br/>

## Abstract Classes

You may have noticed a chance to improve the `Polygon` example above. Both the `Triangle` and `Rectangle` examples above have a `get_area()` method. Wouldn't it be nice if we could include that in `Polygon` somehow? But the problem is that you calculate the area of triangles and rectangles differently, so we can't just write the equation directly in `Polygon`. This is where abstract classes come into play.

What we do when we define an [abstract class](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_%28computer_programming%29#Abstract_and_concrete) is we create the blueprint of all the classes that will inherit from it (the [subclasses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29#Subclasses_and_superclasses)). And we let those subclasses give the details (like how to calculate their area).

In the example above we can modify `Polygon` to become an abstract class:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Polygon(ABC):

    def __init__(self, n):
        self.number_of_sides = n

    def print_num_sides(self):
        print('There are ' + str(self.number_of_sides) + ' sides.')

    @abstractmethod
    def get_area(self):
        pass
```

Here we have imported the Python standard library `abc` to create an abstract class. We subclass `ABC` to define it as an abstract class. And every abstract method we mark with the `@abstractmethod` decorator. This marks the method as not being implemented.

An abstract base class cannot be implemented directly, so we can no longer create a generic `Polygon`:

```python
>>> p = Polygon(3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Polygon with abstract methods get_area
```

And in order to implement a subclass of `Polygon`, it must provide an implementation of all of the abstract methods, like `get_area`:

```python
>>> class Circle(Polygon):
>>>     def __init__(self):
>>>         Polygon.__init__(self, 1)
>>>
>>> c = Circle()
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class Circle with abstract methods get_area
```

But as long as the subclass implements all the abstract methods, we can create an instance of it just like we would any other class:

```python
>>> t = Triangle([3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
>>> print(t.number_of_sides())
3
```

What we did by making `Polygon` abstract is create a more complete blueprint for `Triangle` and `Rectangle`, that includes the idea (if not the implementation) that every polygon has an area. This can be useful in organizing our thoughts in code. If at some point in the distant future we want to add a `Heptadecagon` class, we would have the abstract blueprint in `Polygon` to remind us we need to write a `get_area` method.

<br/>

## Multiple Inheritance

There is one more really major topic we need to cover in OOP before we can move on. Starting with the examples above, imagine we want to create a `Square` class. Now, we could do this by inheriting directly from our abstract `Polygon` class as before:

```python
class Square(Polygon):

    def __init__(self, lenghts_of_side):
        Polygon.__init__(self, 4)
        self.lengths_of_sides = [lengths_of_side]  # list of two numbers

    def get_area(self):
        '''return the area of the rectangle: length x width'''
        x = self.lenghts_of_sides[0]
        return x * x
```

But this misses out on a key idea from basic geometry: squares are just a special type of rectangle. So perhaps it would be better if `Square` inherited from `Rectangle`:

```python
class Square(Rectangle):

    def __init__(self, side):
        Rectangle.__init__(self, [side, side])
```

Not only does recognizing something basic about our system help organize our thoughts, it makes the code much shorter.

We still create an instance of `Square` in the usual way:

```python
>>> s = Square(7.0)
>>> print(s.number_of_sides)
4
```

In the language of OOP, we could describe the above classes in a few ways:

 * `Square` inherits from `Rectangle`, which in turn inherits from `Polygon`.
 * `Square` is a subclass of `Rectangle`, which is a subclass of `Polygon`.
 * `Polygon` is a superclass of `Rectangle`, which is a superclass of `Square`.

The jargon itself is not as important as the relationship between these classes. Multiple inheritance is a powerful abstraction tool, giving us a huge amount of flexibilty to organize our thoughts and thus our code.


### Be Warned

The above example of `Square` seems reasonable enough. But using multiple inhertance is not risk free. You can create classes with subclasses of subclasses of subclasses of subclasses of subclasses of subclasses so deep that you can no longer keep the whole chain of inheritance easily in mind. At some level deep down the rabbit hole adding another layer of abstraction begins to add more complexity than it removes.

Where to draw the line is up to you. Conceptual abstractions can be helpful or confusing. Good design helps, but in the end it is a judgement call.

## More Examples

The two object-oriented programming classes have been quite short. There is not a lot of code to learn here, just a few new ideas. If you haven't seen OOP before, it might be useful to look at some more examples:
